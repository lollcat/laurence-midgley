<p>
I am the co-founder and CTO of <a href="https://www.angstrom-ai.com/">Ångström AI</a> which uses generative ML models to accelerate molecular simulations.
We use our molecular simulations to accurately compute thermodynamic observables (solvation free energy, log P/log D, RBFE etc).

I also love surfing and spending time at home in South Africa.
